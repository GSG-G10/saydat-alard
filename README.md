## Problem :memo: 
After more than three quarters of a century have passed since the Nakba and the displacement of Palestinians from their land, the Palestinian generation suffers from a lack of information about Palestinian cities and villages and what is related to them.

--------
## Solution :bulb:

We came up with the idea of collecting information about Palestinian cities and villages, the Palestinian heritage, and the most famous industries and crops that these cities are famous for, and this is in the context of preserving the Palestinian history that the occupier is trying to steal and overturning the facts.
